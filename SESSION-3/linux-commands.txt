command-name <options> <inputs>
$ --> normal user
# --> root user
command-name --help or man command-name

ls --> list subdirectories

/home/ec2-user 

cd --> change directory
/ --> root directory

ls
ls -l -->lengthy format in alphabetic order
drwxr-xr-x  15 root root 2900 Nov 28 01:53 dev
d --> directory
- --> file
cd .. --> one step back
ls -lr --> reverse alphabetic order
ls -lt --> latest files are on the top
ls -ltr --> old files are on the top
ls -la --> list all files and folders including hidden

CRUD
--------------------
create
read
update
delete

file create
------------
touch --> creates an empty file
mkdir --> make directory

update file with content
-----------------------
cat > <file-name> --> file will open
enter the content
enter and ctrl+d

> --> replaces the content
>> --> appends the content

reading file
-----------------------
cat file-name

remove file and folder
----------------------
rm <file-name> 
rmdir <folder-name> --> removes empty directory
rm -r devops --> recursive --> go inside every folder and delete everything


copy
----------------------
cp <source> <destination>
cp -r --> recursive

cut
----------------------
mv --> move
with in the same folder if you use mv command, it works as rename

mv sivakumar sivakumar-1 --> this will rename the file from sivakumar sivakumar-1


grep command
----------------
grep <word-to-find> <file-name>

Linux is by default case sensitive
Devops and DEVOPS are different

| --> piping one command output will become input to another command

wget vs curl
---------------
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.43.0.windows.1/Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe

wget --> download files
curl --> downloads the text content directly on to terminal

cut and awk
--------------
https://github.com/daws-76s/notes/blob/master/session-01.txt

delimiter --> we get fragments
:
/
---
https:

github.com
daws-76s

cut -d / -f 1

awk
------
awk -F / '{print $1F}'
awk -F / '{print $NF}' --> last fragment

awk command is used to divide the data based on columns

uname
ls
cat
cp
mv
grep
cut
awk
head and tail

head <file-name> --> first 10lines
tail <file-name< --> last 10 lines

Editors
-------------
vim --> visually improved

vim <file-name>

colon/command mode
------------------
:/<word-to-search> --> search from top
:?<word-to-search> --> search from bottom

sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config sshd_config
sudo chown ec2-user:ec2-user sshd_config

replace the content/word
-----------------------
:s/<word-to-find>/<word-to-replace> --> replace the word where your cursor is, this will replace only first occurence in that line

:2s/<word-to-find>/<word-to-replace>
:%s/<word-to-find>/<word-to-replace>/g --> all occurences

permissions
--------------
- rw-	rw-    r--
  user  group  others
  u      g      o
  
R -> 4
W -> 2
X -> 1 -> to run commands and shell scripts

sivakumar --> DevOps Team
user=owner
group=devops
others=testing,development team

in Linux when you create user, a group with same name will be created
sivakumar --> user sivakumar and group with name sivakumar also created

chmod u+x sample

chmod ugo+r sample

sample

u --> RWX
g --> R
o -> 0
740

u --> RWX
g --> RX
o --> X

User management
-------------------
ramesh joined devops team

1. create user
useradd <user-name>
passwd <user-name>

/etc/passwd --> will have user entries
when a user is created, automatically group is created with same username

getent groups
/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> enable password authentication
sshd -t --> checks for syntax of the file
systemctl restart sshd --> 

2. group create

groupadd <group-name>

3. every user will have a primary group and secondary group

ramesh should be added to devops group

usermod -g devops ramesh

chown --> even file owner can't run this commands
only sudo user can change the ownership
chown <user>:<group> file-name
chown <user>:<group> -R folder

4. we will create testing group, we will give ramesh secondary access to testing

usermod -aG testing ramesh

gpasswd -d ramesh testing --> deletes ramesh from testing group

user is leaving organisation
------------------------------
userdel <user-name> --> removes user from linux

first user should be removed from the group

1. project release
2. company release


process management
----------------------------
if you follow process you will get best results

everything in linux is a process...

Team Leader
Team Manager
Account Manager
Senior Engineer
Junior Engineer
Trainee

Team Leader --> 1 ticket created about devops pipelines setup = 1

Senior Engineer --> 1

sub task -> 2 --> Junior Engineer
sub task -> 3 --> Junior Engineer-2

Junior Engineer - 2 
---------------
sub task --> 4 --> trainee
create a CI pipeline --> task completed
ticket 4 --> task completed

task ID --> 4 , parent task --> 3
task 3 --> task 1

whatever we do in linux --> a process id will be created and reported back

ps

echo Hello --> print Hello task given to Linux

I need to create a process ID
2345 --> result is hand overed to bash terminal 3720

foreground process --> block terminal
background process --> runs in background &

when process stucks we need to kill it

kill PID --> process may or may not be terminated

when process stuck even kill can't kill it

kill -9 --> forcefully terminate

nodejs project
----------------

ps -ef | grep nodejs


package management
-----------------------
yum command is used to install packages --> RHEL = centos = fedora = AWS Linux 2
amazon-linux-extras
yum install package-name

apt-get 
raheem joined, how can you enable ssh accesss through private key
------------------------------------------------------
1. create raheem user
2. give me your public key, keep your private key securely.

user --> RWX
group 
Others

chown user:group <file-name>

chmod o+r <file-name>
