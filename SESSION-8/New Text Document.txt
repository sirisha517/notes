Monolithic vs Microservices
--------------------------
2012 TCS

enterprise archive file --> this in only file of entire project

Servlets --> DB connect data
JSPS --> UI --> HTML

1 month time

small change is also a big release
-----------------------------
change management team
they will do document --> client --> approve

DEV --> QA --> UAT --> PROD

FrontEnd --> Backend
HTML, JS, AngularJS
Java

2 files
frontend
backend

maintainance easy


Backend
---------------------
1 file --> user, cart, products, payment, order, dispatch

50 members

products related code need to be changed....

2 weeks 
------------
a change in product display
a change in payment display

a single failure also --> total failure

java/.net

user --> 5 java
cart --> 5 python
product --> 5 NodeJS
payment

Microservices
---------------
maintainance is easy
language can be anything
individual deployments
server resources can be less
autoscaling is very easy



1. products --> heavy load --> wipro

2. user --> they want add to wishlist --> HCL

3. payment --> less load --> TCS

Security groups
---------------
frontend apps --> 80
backend apps --> 80 --> imagine

I selected frontend SG in USER SG

telnet <destination-IP> port

telnet 3.208.3.54 8080

inbound --> incoming traffic
outbound --> outbound --> traffic originates from our server
