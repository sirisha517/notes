LINUX::::


Linux is not operating system --> it is kernel



OS vs Kernel
--------------
Kernel --> connecting to Hardware --> no utilities, no shell

Linus Torvalds --> Linux

Unix --> very costly, tightly coupled to hardware

Linux Kernel --> based on unix principles but code is from the scratch --> C Language

Open source

Kernel + package + shell == OS
Android is flavour of linux
Kernel + package + shell + UI

ubuntu
-------
Desktop --> Kernel + Shell + UI
Server --> Kernel + Shell
centos
RHEL
Fedore
Suse
Arch Linux
99% same --> few commands only will differ

RHEL --> Open source --> but not free
Code open source -> take the code

Support --> immidiate call
community 
RHEL = Centos = Fedora = almalinux = AWS Linux

RHEL --> Code --> OS --> CentOS --> internet community


TO CHECK OS ==> cat /etc/*release
To CHECK VERSION ==> uname -a
